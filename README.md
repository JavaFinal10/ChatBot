# ChatBot
This is a program that will talk to you, if you're feeling lonely or just wanna try out some cool computer coded stuff. Whatever the case is, Morgan is here to talk with you about multiple different subjects!
The code works off of keywords that will throw a randomizer to get different replies out of Morgan, some more interactive than others. Some of the conversations include everyday small talk (weather, how your day was, etc), while others are purely single replies, such as the greetings. If you say hi to Morgan, it will say hi back, or a variation of hello.
Morgan also has compliments and jokes, so if you're feeling down you can ask Morgan for either of the two, and it will deliver! There are a bunch of compliments and jokes to make you feel better about yourself, so make sure to run those dry until you can't laugh anymore!
Morgan is intelligent, and has random facts to share with you. These facts could be common knowledge, or scarcely known information, you won't know until you chat with Morgan!
There are more things to talk about with Morgan, however we don't want to spoil it all for you.
The keywords will be displayed when using Morgan, and will give you a different answer (from the ones we have premade, and from the Random Number Generator).
We hope you enjoy talking with Morgan, because it sure enjoys talking to you!
